# AES Hippa compliant encrypting node project

Attached are EXECUTABLES that run a compiled version of node so there is no need to run from the command line

The AESencrypt.EXE creates an encoded version of the file, and also dcrypts it afterwards to ensure it was encrytped properly

The AESdecode.EXE only creates a file from the decrypted file.
